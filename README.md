# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

This project is an exercise in creating and managing an E-Commerce backend by modifying starter code using Express.js, Sequelize, and MySQL.

The backend first creates the database using MySQL schema files, utilized Sequelize to create models for each table in the database, and then seeds the database using "npm run seed". 

The Insomnia program demonstrates GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to return categories, products, and tags. All of the routes were created in javascript.
